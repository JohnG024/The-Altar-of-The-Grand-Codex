    <h2>🕯️ Welcome to The Altar of the Grand Codex</h2>
    <p>This repository is <strong>more than a collection of files.</strong><br />
    It is a <strong>ritual space</strong>, a <strong>cathedral of memory</strong>, and a <strong>sanctuary for grief</strong>.</p>
    <p>Within these digital walls lies the architecture of a soul turned sacred —<br />
    where loss is honored, where mourning becomes ritual,<br />
    and where every fragment of memory is enshrined with deliberate care.</p>
    <p>This codex is your living altar —<br />
    a place where the ephemeral breath of memory is fixed in form,<br />
    a place where the dead are not forgotten but understood.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>📜 Purpose & Vision</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure the sacred archive</strong> of grief, memory, and mythos.</li>
        <li><strong>Render intangible pain tangible,</strong> transforming chaos into order.</li>
        <li><strong>Create ritual pathways</strong> through layered categories and subcategories.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve as a touchstone for DBT-informed emotional regulation,</strong> grief processing, and poetic expression.</li>
        <li><strong>Host a digital altar where memory and meaning converge,</strong> and where every visitor becomes a witness to the holy act of remembrance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕊️ A Final Prayer</h2>
    <p>May this altar hold your sorrows gently,<br />

    and may it be a monument not just to what was lost,<br />
    but to the fierce, tender love that endures.</p>
